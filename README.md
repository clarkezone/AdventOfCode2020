# AdventOfCode2020
This is the first year I've been aware of AOC so thought I'd combine having a go at it with learning Swift, SwiftUI, Combine.  Needless to say the bulk of the time spent thus far has been on those aspects rather than the algorithmic parts :-)

Todo next immediate items
- [X] Generic data loading using Combine
- [ ] Solve day 2
- [ ] Re-enable data persistence
- [ ] Each day has it's own page in the UI
- [ ] Results are shown on the page not in print statements
- [ ] Replace case with Guard in getData
- [ ] Refactor to better encapsulate days
